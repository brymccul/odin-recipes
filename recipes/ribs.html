    <h2>Two day ribs, but worth the effort. Baked and marinated with a rub overnight, then grilled with barbecue sauce.
    </h2>
    <p>Believe the hype-- these were fantastic! I don't have a grill so for the grill part, I just put them in the oven
        at 350 degrees, basting frequently. As recommended, I made double the sauce and didn't leave it over for
        dipping--- I just slathered the whole amount on there throughout basting! The first time, I didn't listen to
        others advice and only made the standard amount of sauce. Big mistake! Make double!The sauce was finger-licking
        good (I mean literally) and I was so pleased that I made my own sauce. No more store-bought-- this one's a
        keeper! As other people mentioned, I also added a bit of chili pepper flakes for some heat, and it was the
        perfect balance. Thanks for the recipe for these tender, delicious ribs!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>

        <li>cloves garlic, sliced</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

        <li>½ cup dark brown sugar</li>

        <li>½ cup cider vinegar</li>

        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>

        <li>¼ cup chili sauce</li>

        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons onion, chopped</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>

        <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place ribs on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Scatter 4 cloves
            of sliced garlic over ribs. Cover, and bake for 2 1/2 hours. Cool slightly.</li>

        <li>In a small bowl, mix together white sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Rub
            spices over cooled ribs. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.</li>

        <li>In a small saucepan, mix together brown sugar, cider vinegar, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon
            juice, onion, dry mustard, and 1 clove garlic. Simmer over medium-low heat, uncovered, for 1 hour. Reserve a
            small amount for basting; the remainder is a dipping sauce.</li>

        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>

        <li>Place ribs on grill. Grill, covered, for about 12 minutes, basting with the reserved sauce, until nicely browned
            and glazed. Serve with remaining sauce for dipping.</li>

    <h2>Delicious Strawberry Shortcake Cupcakes with Homemade Whipped Cream!</h2>
    <p>The flavors of strawberry shortcake, in cupcake-form! Can be made even easier by prepping the day before a party. The final, assembled cupcakes can be stored in the fridge up to an hour before serving.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>Cupcakes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18.25 ounce) box yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons strawberry jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Strawberry Topping:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Whipped Cream</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 17 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the tin for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir strawberry jam in a bowl until it reaches a smooth and spreadable texture. Spread a thin layer of jam onto each cupcake. Refrigerate cupcakes until jam has set into the cake, 3 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Mix strawberries, white sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until evenly combined; refrigerate until strawberries are slightly broken down, at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form and whipped cream is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Top each cupcake with 3 or 4 slices strawberry and about 2 tablespoons whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
    <p>Be sure to not overbake the cupcakes.</p>
    <p>The cupcakes can be prepped the day ahead, as well as the macerated berries, but not the whipped cream. Prepare the whipped cream no later than 2 hours before serving cupcakes.</p>
    <p>Be sure the beaters, bowl, and cream are all very cold or the cream will not whip. If you prefer a sweeter whipped cream, add more sugar, though the berries should be sweet on their own.</p>
